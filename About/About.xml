	<description>Alters elephants by increasing their carrying capacity from 300 --> 2000. Some other values (like pregnancy and taming) have been altered for balance. The intention was mainly that in endgame animals drain too much performance, yet I need them for caravan weight.
	
- Performance impact: None (will even improve it if you keep less animals now).
- Mod is XML only and overwrites nothing. Contains 6 XPath operations.
- Can safely be added to an existing game.
- Can safely be removed from an existing game as long as you don't have any elephants with gear walking around (or in a caravan) with a carry-weight of more than the vanilla 300.</description>
